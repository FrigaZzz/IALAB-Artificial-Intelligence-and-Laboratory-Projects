# IALAB: Artificial Intelligence and Laboratory Projects

## Overview

This repository encompasses projects developed for the "Artificial Intelligence and Laboratory" course, offered by the Turin Department of Computer Science. The course delves into the intricate realm of Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing an in-depth exploration of intelligent agents' capabilities to draw inferences from explicit knowledge bases within specific domains. It also places a strong emphasis on honing both methodological and project development skills.

## Course Objectives

The primary objectives of the course are:

- **Automated Planning and Execution:** Explore the representation of actions and goals, along with methods for automatic plan generation, particularly in real-world scenarios.

- **Reasoning Under Uncertainty:** Cover probabilistic reasoning, Bayesian networks, reasoning mechanisms for Bayesian networks, and temporal probabilistic models as part of the methodological skills acquired.

- **Implementation of Intelligent Agents:** Develop a proof of concept for an intelligent agent capable of exhibiting both deliberative and reactive behaviors in a partially observable environment. The implementation leverages CLIPS, a robust tool based on production rules, to showcase basic functionalities of problem-solving using its inferential engine.

- **Implementation of a Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Design and implement a learning agent capable of intelligent behavior based on rewards in a game-like environment. This involves utilizing the SOAR cognitive architecture to develop basic functionalities of learning and problem-solving within SOAR.
